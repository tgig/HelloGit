								<h4>1. Fitness</h4>
								<p><b>Chest Flexibility</b>: Flexibility in the chest area is huge in the game of golf. This exercise will allow for better upper body movement in both your backswing, and downswing. We notice many golfers are restricted in their chest movement .  If your chest doesnâ€™t move in the correct way in your golf swing, the whole system breaks down.  You will begin compensating with your spine, hips, and legs to make up for the lack of chest mechanics.  Time to get rid of those nasty habits!</p>

								<h4>2. Golf Drills</h4>
								<p><b>Posture & Grip</b>: We start at the beginning and make sure you're getting it right. It's amazing, but a grand majority of amateur golfers have major issues with their swing and grip, and simply fixing these issues can lead to vast improvement!</p>

								<h4>3. Goals</h4>
								<p><b>Putting</b>: Putt 5 to 10 balls in a row into the hole at a distance of 4-feet</p>

								<h4>4. Video</h4>
								<p>Submit a video to the Pro for feedback, and to get next steps</p>

									<p>
									"I wanted to say thanks for the analysis, drills and tips you've given me.  My iron play has improved dramatically.  Not only have I gained 5-10 yards with each club, I'm hitting more greens in regulation now than ever before, and overall just feel so much more comfortable hitting any of my irons.  So thanks!"  - <b>Mike Kluft</b>
									</p>
									<hr />
									<p>
									"On Saturday morning I broke 90 for the first time! Thank you so much for your continued coaching and encouragement. I have quite a bit of work left to do on the last drills you sent me."  - <b>jeremyj...@g....com</b>
									</p>
									<hr />
									<p>
									"Brad, can't tell you how much you've helped my balance and direction. I'm shooting in low 80s lately by working on tempo.  Your drills have helped tremendously.  Some golfing friends have been noticing that they too have weight transfer problems. " - <b>rondep....@g....com</b>
									</p>
									<hr />
									<p>
									"I need to thank you for the first two lessons, I have seen tremendous improvement in my game,  About 4 strokes off my game so far." - <b>Kevin Harris</b>
									</p>
									<hr />
									<p>
									"I just want to say, your advice on my swing I sent in was awesome!! It helped me have a straighter ball flight. Love the pro looper."
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span5 offset1">
									<p>
									"Brad, I want to brag on you. On Saturday, I had 3 kickin birdies on the back nine. My husband was very impressed. I'm hitting the ball longer and straighter. This system is really working for me. I've had lessons before from pros but not with this success. I'm a big believer in Swing by Swing. Thanks for being there." - <b>Kathy </b>
									</p>
									<hr />
									<p>
									"Last game I played I finally got in contention with the guys I play with and they were blown away P.S. I'm gonna try and send you some videos this week thanks a lot for all your help and patience lol" - <b>James Griffith </b>
									</p>
									<hr />
									<p>
									"I would like to thank you and Brad for helping me shoot my second lowest score since High school. Brad's simple advice to my swing paid off with great dividends today.  With a quite lower body I was able to hit my drives straight with a slight draw.  My bad shots today were when I reverted back to my old swing habits. I will continue with the lessons Brad gave me to work on and send in another video. If you would pass this onto Brad, along with my thanks. Today was a very enjoyable round of Golf!  PS:  I dropped 13 strokes from the last two times I golfed."  - <b>dirconstruct...@h...com</b>

					<h4>Is this a real person or an automated computer?</h4>
					<br />
					A real, live, PGA pro who has given thousands of video lessons, will review your video, draw lines on top of it, and do a voice-over lesson. 
				
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Can I sign up if I'm not in the States?</h4>
					<br />
					YES! Swing by Swing Professional Instruction works from anywhere in the world as long as you have internet access.
					<br />
					<br />
					It is especially good for those who cannot find quality instruction in their local area.

					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Can I use this anywhere in the world? Do I have to be based in USA?</h4>
					<br />
					Anybody in the world can use these lessons to improve their game. Many of our clients are located outside of the USA!
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
				
					<h4>When I submit a video, how long does it take to turn around?</h4>
					<br />
					It usually takes only 24 hours to record your lessons and get it back to you. In cases of extreme volume, it can take up to 48 hours.

					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>How do I get a lesson?</h4>
					<br />
					Once you enroll, we will send you simple instructions to activate your lessons.
						
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>How do I submit videos?</h4>
					<br />
					You can upload videos via our website, or email them to us. We will verify that your videos have been successfully received, and notify you again when your lesson is ready to watch.
					
						
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>This sounds too good to be true</h4>
					<br />
					Nope! It's the future of golf development... We use technology to streamline the time of a golf pro, so he can focus on what he is very good at: giving lessons. 

					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
				
					<h4>How long do I have to use my lessons?</h4>
					<br />
					The class runs for 8-weeks, and you get 12-months of Pro Looper video instruction included. So, you get hands-on training for 8-weeks, and 12 full months to submit videos and get feedback.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>How do I contact customer support if I have a question?</h4>
					<br />
					You can send an email to <a href="contact@swingbyswing.com">contact@swingbyswing.com</a> <br />or visit our <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/swingbyswing" target="_blank">support forum</a>.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>How can we give such high quality lessons at a fraction of the price?</h4>
					<h4>And, how does one pro handle all these people when you have a million users?</h4>
					<br />
					<i>Technology!</i> We use technology to streamline the job of our PGA Pro, so he can focus simply on doing what he's great at - giving lessons and analyzing golf swings - and spend zero time on things like getting new customers, paperwork, standing behind somebody for an hour, etc. Our system can scale to an infinite number of pros, so when one pro gets overwhelmed, we'll bring in another to service you and keep quality high.
					<br />
					<br />
					Your Pro is assigned to you, and will be your dedicated golf coach for every lesson. The more lessons he gives, the more he knows about you, and the more information he has at his fingertips. Every lesson gets more dialed in, and more effective.
					<br />
					<br />
					Technology also puts way more information at the fingertips of your golf coach than is traditionally available to most instructors. If you use Swing by Swing GPS and Scorecard on the course, you'll collect valuable stats and tendencies that are available to your pro when he analyzes your swing. 
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Who should <i>not</i> take these lessons?</h4>
					<br />
					Video lessons are not for everybody! If you already regularly shoot in the 70's, you may not gain as much benefit as those who shoot 80+.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you shoot 90+ regularly, your coach should be able to help you significantly improve your game!
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>What kind of information can my coach get from a simple video?</h4>
					<br />
					Every detail of a golf swing can be analyzed, because after all, the ball flight itself is just an extension of your swing. These days, everybody from PGA Pros to aspiring junior golfers use video lessons to get better.
					<br />
					<br />
					Plus, if you use Swing by Swing GPS on the course, your coach will have access to all your other stats and tendencies to round out the information that can't be inferred from your swing.

					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Is this a recurring plan or a one-time purchase?</h4>
					<br />
					This is a recurring membership. Your PRO LOOPER membership will renew at the same price next year. You can cancel anytime and never be charged again.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>What is the turnaround time on these videos?</h4>
					<br />
					We try very hard to turn around all video lessons with 24 hours. In cases of extreme volume, it may take 48-72 hours. (But that's pretty rare)
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Can I work on short game stuff? Chipping and putting?</h4>
					<br />
					Yes! A good portion of the course material will be based on the short game. Even after the course is over you can submit videos on your short game for feedback and instruction.
					<br />
					<br />
					You can be assured that your pro will always be ready and willing to work on whatever you want.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>In videos, do I have to hit a golf ball or can I just swing my club?</h4>
					<br />
					It is recommended that you hit an actual golf ball when filming your swing. Have you ever taken a couple of perfect practice swings, then stood over the ball and duffed it out-of-bounds? Yep... we all do - it's amazing how much of a difference simply hitting a small white object can make to your golf swing. It's just fine, though, to hit a practice ball, plastic wiffle ball, or into a net.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Does this work for beginning golfers?</h4>
					<br />
					This works especially well for beginning golfers! These lessons are an easy way to learn the basics of a golf swing, under the wing of an experienced, professional, and patient mentor.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Does this work for female golfers?</h4>
					<br />
					We have lots of female golfers as clients. Our head PGA pro, Brad Smith, has formerly been a college golf coach for the mens & womens teams, and has coached many women.
					<br />
					<br />
					Here is an example of Brad Smith giving a lesson to one of our female clients.

					</div>

					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Does this work for child golfers?</h4>
					<br />
					Our golf pro takes special delight in teach young children and teens to play the game of golf. After all, they're the future of this great sport!
					<br />
					<br />
					Here is an example of a lesson with a young beginner child.

					<div class="pl-vid-vg vidlesson margin-left50 margin-top20 text-center background-midgreen cursorlink" style="width: 300px;">
						<div class="font-oneeighty">Vitali</div>
						<div class="font-onetwenty margin-bottom10">11/5/2012 - Beginner</div>
						<img src="/content/img/pl-video-vg.png" alt="Child video lesson with Vitali" />
					</div>

					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Can I ask my instructor questions?</h4>
					<br />
					Yes! When you submit your video, you can ask your instructor a specific question. Then, after you get your video lesson back, you can ask more questions. It's easy, and your instructor will answer quickly.	
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>Do I need a smart phone, or can I use a camera?</h4>
					<br />
					You can use pretty much any digital camera to capture your swing and send it to us. You just need to upload your video via our website, or email it to your coach. 
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>What if I don't like my instructor? Can I get a different one?</h4>
					<br />
					If you don't like your instructor, or if you don't feel like you're getting value out of the instruction, you can request a refund within 30-days and get your money back. If you take 4 lessons and see no improvement, we'll refund 200% of your purchase price. No questions asked.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />

					<h4>What if I can't take all my lessons? Do I get some money back?</h4>
					<br />
					No, sorry... at this price, we can't afford to refund money for people who don't take advantage of their course work. 
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />


					<h4>How can the Swing by Swing GPS app complement my lessons?</h4>
					<br />
					Usage of the mobile app is not required to take these golf lessons, but when you do use the mobile app, you get a lot of benefits!
					<br />
					<br />
					Plus, all the technology of LOOPER comes included for a full year! All the scores and stats and club tracker info you collect through the Swing by Swing mobile app is included at your golf coach's fingertips, and he can use it to provide more robust and informed instruction.
					<br />
					<br />
					All you need to do is use the Swing by Swing mobile app on the course when you're golfing, or you can keep your stats manually and enter them via the website. The rest will happen automatically when you take a lesson.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
