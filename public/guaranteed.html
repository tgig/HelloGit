                                <p><b>Chest Flexibility</b>: Flexibility in the chest area is huge in the game of golf. This exercise will allow for better upper body movement in both your backswing, and downswing. We notice many golfers are restricted in their chest movement .  If your chest doesn’t move in the correct way in your golf swing, the whole system breaks down.  You will begin compensating with your spine, hips, and legs to make up for the lack of chest mechanics.  Time to get rid of those nasty habits!</p>

                                <h4>2. Golf Drills</h4>
                                <p><b>Posture & Grip</b>: We start at the beginning and make sure you're getting it right. It's amazing, but a grand majority of amateur golfers have major issues with their swing and grip, and simply fixing these issues can lead to vast improvement!</p>

                                <h4>3. Goals</h4>
                                <p><b>Putting</b>: Putt 5 to 10 balls in a row into the hole at a distance of 4-feet</p>

                                <h3>The Backswing</h3>
                                <h4>1. Fitness</h4>
                                <p>
                                <b>Spine Rotation</b>: The backswing has so many elements that have the potential to breakdown.  The key this week is add weight resistance, along with some spine and hip flexibility.  An accurate and powerful spine rotation is absolutely key to get that explosive impact on the ball.  Your drives will thank you here.
                                </p>

                                <h4>2. Drills</h4>
                                <p>
                                <b>Backswing Mechanics</b>:  Now that you have the correct setup, let’s work on the first movement of the club - the backswing.  Many golfers have the mentality that impact and follow through are the keys to a successful swing - not  true.  A solid swing is powered by having the correct mechanics in place in the backswing.  Getting the proper spine rotation on the backswing will have explosive effects on your distance. 
                                </p>

                                <p><b>Putting</b>: Putt 10 to 25+ balls in a row into the hole at a distance of 4 feet. Don’t leave until you achieve your goal!</p>

                                <p>
                                <b>Ankle and Pelvis</b>: Flexibility, flexibility...flexibility!  This week we’re focusing on ankle and pelvic mobility.  With as much power as we generate in our golf swing, our ankles have a tendency to roll on us, and our hips slide.  Getting flexible in these areas will allow for a smoother swing and follow through.  Not to mention, reduce the risk of injury.
                                </p>

                                <h4>2. Drills</h4>

                                <b>Chest, Arm, and Wrist Movement</b>: It’s time to have all these moving parts work as one golf swinging machine.  It’s imperative we get you in the correct position at the top on your swing.  Just think, if you’re off by the slightest degree here, your downswing and impact will turn into a nightmare.  It’s all downhill from here...
                                </p>

                                <b>Distance Putting</b>: Using the distance of entire green, putt 2 balls to land on the fringe (Or "Frog Hair") in a row.  Not looking for accuracy to go in a hole here, tempo and muscle memory are the focus.
                                </p>

                                <b>Stability</b>: A solid foundation is necessary to create power in the golf swing.  This week will focus on keeping a strong foundation in the lower half of the body, while performing golf movements with the upper half.  Time to identify how to separate your lower body from your upper body.
                                </p>

                                <b>Weight Transfer</b>: Time to uncoil our stored energy (or, potential energy) during the downswing.  The order in which you transfer your weight is vital to a square impact on the ball.  Instilling muscle memory of the proper way to transfer your weight will reflect in your consistency on the course.
                                </p>

                                <b>Uncoiling</b>: There are so many factors that could go wrong in the downswing, so we broke it up into 2 separate weeks.  Uncoiling the chest and hips at the proper time is the #1 key in squaring up your club head at time of impact.  A square clubface means straight shots every time.  Golf isn’t looking so hard anymore, is it??
                                </p>

                                <b>Explosiveness, Part 2</b>: We’re going to carryover the theme of explosiveness from week 5 into this week too.  Being explosive is great if you’re an American football player, but this is golf.  We need to be explosive but still have the accuracy to swing a club 100+ mph and hit a little white ball.  Pretty incredible.

Good thing you have the correct mechanics in place to give you success at this moment.  Golf has a huge mental aspect to it.  We’ll get you in the right place mentally, since it’s just as important as the mechanics of your swing.

                                <b>Balance</b>: With so much forward motion being generated after impact, it’s easy for many of us to lose our balance.  The follow through is just as important as the downswing.  Finishing the swing efficiently will have great effects on your shot.

Not only have I gained 5-10 yards with each club, I'm hitting more greens in regulation now than ever before, and overall just feel so much more comfortable hitting any of my irons. So thanks!" - <b>Mike Kluft</b>

Brad's simple advice to my swing paid off with great dividends today. With a quite lower body I was able to hit my drives straight with a slight draw. My bad shots today were when I reverted back to my old swing habits. I will continue with the lessons Brad gave me to work on and send in another video. If you would pass this onto Brad, along with my thanks. Today was a very enjoyable round of Golf! PS: I dropped 13 strokes from the last two times I golfed." - <b>dirconstruct...@h...com</b>

            <h4>Can I sign up if I'm not in the States?</h4>
            <br />
            YES! Swing by Swing Professional Instruction works from anywhere in the world as long as you have internet access.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is especially good for those who cannot find quality instruction in their local area.

            <h4>Can I use this anywhere in the world? Do I have to be based in USA?</h4>
            <br />
            Anybody in the world can use these lessons to improve their game. Many of our clients are located outside of the USA!

            <h4>When I submit a video, how long does it take to turn around?</h4>
            <br />

            <h4>This sounds too good to be true</h4>
            <br />
            It's the future of golf development... We use technology to streamline the time of a golf pro, so he can focus on what he is very good at: giving personal lessons to you. Many people comment that the value of this program really is worth more than $800.

            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
        
            <h4>How long do I have to use my lessons?</h4>
            <br />
            The class runs for 8-weeks, and you get 12-months of Pro Looper video instruction included. So, you get hands-on training for 8-weeks, and 12 full months to submit videos and get feedback.

            <h4>How do I contact customer support if I have a question?</h4>
            <br />
            You can send an email to <a href="contact@swingbyswing.com">contact@swingbyswing.com</a> <br />or visit our <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/swingbyswing" target="_blank">support forum</a>.

            <h4>How can we give such high quality lessons at a fraction of the price?</h4>
            <h4>And, how does one pro handle all these people when you have a million users?</h4>
            <br />
            The short answer is: <i>Technology</i>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The long answer is: We use technology to streamline the job of our PGA Pro, so he can focus simply on doing what he's great at - giving lessons and analyzing golf swings - and spend zero time on things like getting new customers, paperwork, standing behind somebody for an hour, etc. Our system can scale to an infinite number of pros, so when one pro gets overwhelmed, we'll bring in another to service you and keep quality high.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your Pro is assigned to you, and will be your dedicated golf coach for every lesson. The more lessons he gives, the more he knows about you, and the more information he has at his fingertips. Every lesson gets more dialed in, and more effective.
            <br />
            <br />
            Technology also puts way more information at the fingertips of your golf coach than is traditionally available to most instructors. If you use Swing by Swing GPS and Scorecard on the course, you'll collect valuable stats and tendencies that are available to your pro when he analyzes your swing. 
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            <h4>Who should <i>not</i> take these lessons?</h4>
            <br />
            Video lessons are not for everybody! If you already regularly shoot in the 70's, you may not gain as much benefit from the golf instruction as those who shoot 80+. (Though, the golf specific fitness and flexibility could be of tremendous use to anybody.)
            <br />
            <br />
            If you shoot 90+ regularly, your coach should be able to help you significantly improve your game!
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are confused about what exercises would be beneficial to your golf game, or how to structure your practice time on the course, this class is for you.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            <h4>What kind of information can my coach get from a simple video?</h4>
            <br />
            Every detail of a golf swing can be analyzed, because after all, the ball flight itself is just an extension of your swing. These days, everybody from PGA Pros to aspiring junior golfers use video lessons to get better.
            <br />
            <br />
            Plus, if you use Swing by Swing GPS on the course, your coach will have access to all your other stats and tendencies to round out the information that can't be inferred from your swing.

            <h4>Is this a recurring plan or a one-time purchase?</h4>
            <br />
            This is a recurring membership. Your PRO LOOPER membership will renew at the same price next year. You can cancel anytime and never be charged again.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            <h4>What is the turnaround time on these videos?</h4>
            <br />
            We try very hard to turn around all video lessons with 24 hours. In cases of extreme volume, it may take 48-72 hours. (But that's pretty rare)
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            <h4>Can I work on short game stuff? Chipping and putting?</h4>
            <br />
            Yes! A good portion of the course material will be based on the short game. Even after the course is over you can submit videos on your short game for feedback and instruction.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can be assured that your pro will always be ready and willing to work on whatever you want.

            <h4>In videos, do I have to hit a golf ball or can I just swing my club?</h4>
            <br />
            It is recommended that you hit an actual golf ball when filming your swing. Have you ever taken a couple of perfect practice swings, then stood over the ball and duffed it out-of-bounds? Yep... we all do - it's amazing how much of a difference simply hitting a small white object can make to your golf swing. It's just fine, though, to hit a practice ball, plastic wiffle ball, or into a net.

            <h4>Does this work for beginning golfers?</h4>
            <br />
            This works especially well for beginning golfers! These lessons are an easy way to learn the basics of a golf swing, under the wing of an experienced, professional, and patient mentor.

            <h4>Does this work for female golfers?</h4>
            <br />
            We have lots of female golfers as clients. Our head PGA pro, Brad Smith, has formerly been a college golf coach for the mens & womens teams, and has coached many women.

            <h4>Does this work for child golfers?</h4>
            <br />
            Our golf pro takes special delight in teach young children and teens to play the game of golf. After all, they're the future of this great sport!

            <br />

            <h4>Can I ask my instructor questions?</h4>
            <br />
            Yes! When you submit your video, you can ask your instructor a specific question. Then, after you get your video lesson back, you can ask more questions. It's easy, and your instructor will answer quickly.   
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            <h4>Do I need a smart phone, or can I use a camera?</h4>
            <br />
            You can use pretty much any digital camera to capture your swing and send it to us. You just need to upload your video via our website, or email it to your coach. 
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            <h4>What if I don't like my instructors? Can I get different ones?</h4>
            <br />
            If you don't like your instructors, or if you don't feel like you're getting value out of the instruction, you can request a refund within 30-days and get your money back. If you take 4 lessons and see no improvement, we'll refund 200% of your purchase price. No questions asked.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            <h4>What if I can't take all my lessons? Do I get some money back?</h4>
            <br />
            No, sorry... if you put in the time, you're guaranteed to get value out of it. If you don't think you'll partake in the instruction, don't buy it.
            <br />

            <br />


            <h4>How can the Swing by Swing GPS app complement my lessons?</h4>
            <br />
            Usage of the mobile app is not required to take these golf lessons, but when you do use the mobile app, you get a lot of benefits!
            <br />
            <br />
            Plus, all the technology of LOOPER comes included for a full year! All the scores and stats and club tracker info you collect through the Swing by Swing mobile app is included at your golf coach's fingertips, and he can use it to provide more robust and informed instruction.
            <br />
            <br />
            All you need to do is use the Swing by Swing mobile app on the course when you're golfing, or you can keep your stats manually and enter them via the website. The rest will happen automatically when you take a lesson.
